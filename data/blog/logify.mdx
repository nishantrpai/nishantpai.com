Situation
=========

For the past month, I've monitored all my decisions and events that happened.

For e.g.,

May 07 2021 18:04:00: Sent an email to the client

[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41565ac9-d135-4b1e-be87-2d2de5995482_160x160.gif)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41565ac9-d135-4b1e-be87-2d2de5995482_160x160.gif)

Process
=======

Whenever I needed to create a new event, I would:

-   Open `https://www.epochconverter.com/`

-   Copy the timestamp

-   Paste the timestamp in my journal

-   Write the event

Repeat this 100 times a day ðŸ˜“

Why?
====

The outcome was helpful.

This system allowed me to keep track of all my ongoing projects and experiments I was currently working on.

Client interactions regarding something would be logged.Â 

Could look at it after the weekend and instantly know where I left off.

Analysis
========

**Thoughts:**

1.  Want the outcome

1.  Process to achieve is tedious

1.  I can program

**Decision:Â **

Make a website where you can:

1.  Write the event

2.  Press copy and get a timestamped event

3.  Paste in your Logfile

Result
======

So it was built ðŸ¥³

https://logify.vercel.app

1.  Go to the website

2.  Enter the event

3.  Press copy

4.  Paste it in your logfile

About the project:
==================

*Concern:Â *

Am I storing user data?

No.

Everything is on github. Raise a PR if you want to.

[Here](https://github.com/nishantrpai/logify/blob/master/Log.md
) is an example of the logs I kept for this project.


Philosophy
==========

If you are working on a long term project such as starting a newsletter, business or page, there are many steps prior to your first day.Â 

Keep a record of the decisions you made and events that happened along the way. This will help you remember and gain insights.

Avoid what doesn't work

Do what works.

Continue.
