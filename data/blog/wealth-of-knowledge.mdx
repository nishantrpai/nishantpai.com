*Sanskrit Shloka:*\
न चोरहार्यं न च राजहार्यं\
न भ्रातृभाज्यं न च भारकारी ।\
व्यये कृते वर्धते एव नित्यं\
विद्याधनं सर्वधन प्रधानम् ॥

*English:*

Can't be stolen by a thief, can't be snatched by kings,

Can't be partitioned by brothers, nor is it heavy.

The more you expend, the more it grows;

The wealth of knowledge is the supreme of all wealth.
